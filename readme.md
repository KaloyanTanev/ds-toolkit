## Decentralized Storage Toolkit

See [docs](docs/) for more information

### Status
EARLY EXPERIMENTAL!

### Goal
This project seeks to create a set of tools that could be used to build dapps that allow users to store, manage, and share data on decentralized networks.

- Users should be in full control of their data.
  - Data is encrypted and stored in decentralized networks
  - Data owner has sole control over the encryption key on the client side
  - Data owner does not need intermediary to access data
- The identity system is decentralized.
  - Dapp does not depend on its internal database to implement login
  - Users could share data peer to peer
- Dapp could use centralized backend services to augment decentralized services
  - A dapp could use its internal services to provide search experiences
  - A dapp could use its internal database to augment the metadata and enrich the user interface
  
### Components

#### Identity

- A dapp could implement login
- Allow users to interact on a peer to peer data network

#### Encryption, Permission, and Sharing
- To be added

#### Byte Storage
- To be added
