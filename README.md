## Decentralized Storage Toolkit

See [docs](docs) for more information.

### Status
EARLY EXPERIMENTAL!

### Goal
This project seeks to create a set of tools that could be used to build dapps that allow users to store, manage, and share data peer to peer or on decentralized networks.

- The identity system is decentralized
  - Dapp does not depend on its internal database to implement login
  - Users have readable id name
  - Users can rotate keys
- Users have full control of their data
  - Data owner does not need intermediary to access data
  - Intermediaries do not have control because data is always encrypted
  - Data could be shared peer to peer
  - Data could be shared over decentralized networks
- Dapp could use centralized backend services to augment decentralized services
  - A dapp could use its internal services to provide search experiences
  - A dapp could use its internal database to augment the metadata and enrich the user interface
